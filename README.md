##### SeGaSA ver. 1.0a (updated 24/6/2021)

SeGaSA  (Sequential  Gamma  Spectra  Analysis)  is  a  software  complementing  the  Windows 
application DPPMCA from Amptek used for radiation spectra acquisition and analysis. SeGaSA 
analyzes  sets  of  .mca  output  files  and  produces plots showing  the  time dependence of basic spectrometric parameters of a CdTe semiconductor detector.

Please read the SeGaSA user manual for information on how to run and use the software. If github renders the pdf incorrectly (e.g. missing pages), download the file and open it locally.

SeGaSA was developed as a part of bachelor's thesis "Software design for automation of the spectra processing for a semiconductor detector with polarization effect". The bachelor's thesis supervised by Ing. Katarína Sedlačková, PhD. and written by Bc. Filip Frank was successfully defended in June 2021.
